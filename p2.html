            <p> The Project which officially started at the start of the year, to set the context about this capstone project, it is targetted towards decreasing the waiting time of patients. As we all know, KKH caters to a lot of the sick, which a lot of
                the times are the elderly. Sometimes the elderly may go into a panic when they realise that the queuing times are taking too long, making them paranoid that they may have missed a queue no.. To address this problem, I worked in a team
                of 4, including Sean, Yi Shen, Jarrel and Myself, together with the help of mentors who are experts in the field, as well as teachers, we went through many iterations of meetings and discussions. </p>

        <p>Above are some images of the site. This happened during the time where the team went to visit the site in person and had our first face to face meet with our mentor. This site visit was very enriching as it allowed us to better understand what
            was going on behind the scenes in the pharmaacy and what the real delays are. Ultimately, we eventually decided upon the counting pill process as the major delay in the pharmaceutical process</p>
        <p>
            After 2 months of dedicated working on the project, we came up with the final prototype as seen below. This prototype makes use computer vision, where a machine learning model is used to count pills and a local server is hosted:
