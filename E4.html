                    <p class="main-body1">This was the second time I went through OEE, the first time was when I was still in Secondary 2. However, this time around, as a SNW representative, I was tasked to guide my juniors through the OEE experience. The OEE experience consisted
                        of hiking through Bukit Timah hill, as well as stopping at the checkpoints along the way. After the hike up the hill, we had to hike downhill as well, and all the way back to our school in SST, where we would set up camp, cook
                        our own food and stay overnight for a day.</p>

                    <p class="main-body1">After the hike, it was mentally and physically taxing. However, this being my second time and me being fitter than before, it was not as much of a challenge. It was more of a challenge for the juniors though as a lot of them were starting
                        to feel the exhuastion of the hike up and back to school, which can be seen in their faces. It was also not an easy task to communicate and keep conversation with the juniors as everyone was tired during the hike and wanted to
                        conserve their energy. Yet in the end, we all got back together to celebrate the end of the hike and it was quite an enjoyable experience. </p>
