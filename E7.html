                    <p class="main-body1">The trip to SenseTime was an enlightening one. Over there we learnt about artificial intelligence, how it was being used in camera technology to track people (for security reasons) and AI's ability to make very accurate predictions.
                        We also stumbled upon a chinese chess robot that could play chinese chess with you. You could also choose to change the difficulty as you see fit. </p>

                    <p class="main-body1">This trip was quite enriching as I got to learn more about the advancing technology in the world, as well as how AI is being incorporated in the systems. I also found it really interesting and slightly terrified at the thought of the
                        tracking cameras as with just a look at your face, the AI is able to track who you are, your approximate age, and everything in between. </p>
