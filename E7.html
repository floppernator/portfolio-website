                    <p class="main-body1">The program was held by special guests from accredify as well as SMU which came over to SST to monitor our work during the 2 days. This hackathon consisted of three problem statements, of which we had to solve one of them. Our team
                        decided to solve the problem of young entrepreneurs, not having the resources, guidance, and feedback that they need in order to start up their own ideas and businesses. Our solution was to create a reddit-esque website, where
                        it is forum based, allowing young entrepreneurs to ask questions, and mentors to flock to the post and give their answers. Of course, there needs to be something that would attract mentors over. Hence, we implement a monetisation
                        system, where mentors can advertise their services when they reach a certain amount of reputation on the app. Reputation is gained when someone likes your comments, which is an indication of good advice. With this solution, our
                        team managed to receive the best business plan award. </p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p class="main-body1">Through this 2 day hackathon, I managed to learn more about software solutions. I learnt that solutions do not have to physical, but can also be done through software, like creating a website. The website serves as a portal to reach
                        out to others, which helps out people based on the purpose of the website. I also learnt that incentives are really important to create an ecosystem. Without incentives, no one would use your application and no one would want to
                        take part in your solution. That's why incentives are really important. Overall, the experience was quite enriching and enjoyable.</p>
