                    <p class="main-body1">DC-Outreach is an annual event that is held by the Digital Citizenship Board (DCB) where Digital Citizenship Leaders (DCL) invite groups of primary school children over to SST in order to learn more about facilitation. This event teaches
                        primary school students how to facilitate with the help of DCL facilitators, which makes use of the topic of smart devices and the internet to communicate and get to know the students better. On the right it shows an icebreaker
                        activity where students have to try to build the tallest newspaper tower as they can without it toppling over. Students will go through a series of lectures afterwards, on how to keep safe online as well as how to facilitate effective
                        discussions, where after all these lectures. They will put their newfound knowledge to the test and present in front of the crowd.</p>

                        As a facilitator for the primary school students at the DC-Outreach event, I found the experience incredibly rewarding and insightful. Watching the children engage in the icebreaker activity, where they eagerly built newspaper towers, was both entertaining
                        and a great way to break the initial ice. This hands-on activity seamlessly transitioned into more structured lectures on online safety and effective facilitation techniques. Seeing the students absorb the material and later confidently
                        present their ideas to the crowd was a testament to their enthusiasm and our guidance. The blend of practical activities and educational content created a dynamic learning environment that not only educated the students but also
                        empowered them to become better digital citizens.</p>
