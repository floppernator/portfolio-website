                    <p class="main-body1">The beach clean up is a class initated project, where we went to East Coast Park to pick up rubbish near the shores. This was planned by the whole class, where we split into different teams to think of how to execute the project. I
                        was part of the logistics team, where we had to get the items needed for the beach clean up, consisting mainly of tongs and plastic bags.</p>

                    <p class="main-body1">Reflecting on our beach cleanup project, I felt very proud and had a sense of accomplishment The day went smoothly, thanks to the effort and planning from everyone involved. As part of the logistics team, it was great to see that gathering
                        tongs and plastic bags paid off, making the cleanup process efficient and effective. Working alongside my classmates, picking up rubbish along the shores of East Coast Park, was an enjoyable experience as it brought us closer together
                        and made us more aware of our impact on the environment. Seeing the difference we made and knowing we helped preserve the beauty of the park was overall very rewarding and got me to appreciate our nature and environment even more.</p>
